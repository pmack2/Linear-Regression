In our example we will use machine learning computer vision and human vision as a frame of references. 
Computer Vision
When computer vision sees this image of an Iguana
Human Vision
When humans see the image of the Iguana neurons fire in the brain 
– the Visual Cortex interprets these firings as an Iguana.
Silicon Neural Networks
Silicon Neural Networks are composed of inputs
Silicon Neural Networks are loosely modeled after the human visual cortex.
Biological Neurons and a Silicon Node both make connections to other neurons and nodes.
To effectively train a Silicon Neural Network you need to feed it large
varied
Silicon Neural Network start with zero knowledge of subject matter.
Nodes are assigned random weights and biases to help calculate what the Matrix will look like.
Biological neurons connect with other biological neurons while Silicon nodes connect with other silicon nodes.
Know try to rap your head around this – Silicon Neural Networks start out with zero knowledge.
When the algorithm starts silicon nodes are randomly assigned biases and a weight by the AI algorithm.
At the end of the process those weights and biases create the Matrix.
Let’s review the primary takeaways from this section.
 we will overview of how Silicon Neural Networks work. 
 it sees the Matrix.
 input layer
 and real-world labelled datasets.
